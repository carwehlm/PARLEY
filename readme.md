Check out more about PARLEY in our SEAMS 2024 paper, publicly available on Arxiv.org here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17187.pdf. 

To replicate our experiments, you need to install EvoChecker using maven.
To this end, navigate to `./Applications/EvoChecker-master` and run `mvn install` \
EvoChecker should be installed and executable from `./Applications/EvoChecker-master/target/EvoChecker-1.1.0.jar`

```
cd ./Applications/EvoChecker-master
mvn install
cd ../../

java -jar ./Applications/EvoChecker-master/target/EvoChecker-1.1.0.jar
```

If you are not using macOS you need to download the correct PRISM version for your machine from
https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/download.php ans install it.

Check if at least one of the two commands work:
```
./Applications/prism/bin/prism # macOS
prism
```

Finally, we require the following python packages:
- numpy
- collections
- copy
- csv
- heapq
- os
- seaborn
- matplotlib.pyplot
- deap.tools._hypervolume.pyhv
- scipy.stats
- subprocess
- json
- multiprocessing
- re

This command should be sufficient:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

You can replicate our experiments with running the following scripts:

**RQ1_2.py** 
```
python3 RQ1_2.py
```

- creates 90 random maps of size 10x10
- synthesises PRISM models from these maps with Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
- uses PRISM to generate the baseline solution
- invokes our script to synthesise an uncertainty controller using the PARLEY methodology
- invokes EvoChecker (with multiple processors, set num_processes=1 if you want to use only one processor)
- generates Pareto-fronts and puts them in the plots/fronts directory
- runs a statistical analysis using Hypervolume and Spread across all 90 maps over 10 repetitions

**RQ3.py**
```
python3 RQ3.py
```
- generates maps of different sizes that can be used for scalability analysis

---

Alongside, we provide a PRISM model for the web-server in `./models/servers/`

Finally, we provide the code to replicate the turtlebot application in the `./turtlebot` directory alongside a dedicated README file.

Any generated data used in our study can be found in the `./Applications/EvoChecker-main/data` directory
